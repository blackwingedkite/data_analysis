Specifically, the VIFs for \"cylinders,\" \"displacement,\" \"horsepower,\" \"weight,\" and \"model year\" are greater than 10, which indicates strong collinearity. This means that these features are highly correlated with each other, and their coefficients may be unstable or difficult to interpret.\n","\n","One way to address this issue is to remove some of the highly correlated features or transform them into a different set of variables that are less correlated. Another way is to use regularization techniques such as Ridge regression or Lasso regression, which can reduce the impact of collinearity on the regression coefficients.\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"yh9fD2h2a1Ok"}}]}
